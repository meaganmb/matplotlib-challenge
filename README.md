# Matplotlib-challenge
This is the matplotlib week 5 homework in the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## Data Observation (also in .ipynb file)
* From the data, we observed Capomulin drug regimen was tested the most for the treatment of mice whereas Propriva was tested the least.
* We also observated there's a strong positive correlation between mice weight and average tumor volume (0.84) i.e the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor volume observed.
* Furthermore, we also noticed that there are 51% male mice and 49% female mice in the data.
* We observed Infubinol drug regimen left mice with the largest final tumor volume.
